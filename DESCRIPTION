Description: A statistical method to analyse allele-specific expression (ASE) data. ASPEN estimates beta-binomial paramaters, mean and dispersion, from the allelic counts.
            Then, it models allelic dispersion as a function of total gene expresion and uses Bayesian haerarchial model to shrink the estimated dispersion towards the expected one,
            thereby stabilizing estimates and reducing the impact of spurious variability. ASPEN can be used to (i) identify genes with allelic imabalance 
            (those with mean allelic ratio deviating from the theoretical value of 0.5); (ii) identify genes with allelic disperion different from the expected one for the genes with similar expression levels;
            (iii) identify genes with changes in their allelic distribution over time; (iv) identify genes with changes in their allelic variation over time.
